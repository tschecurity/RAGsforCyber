#Python script that detects Personally Identifiable Information (PII) vulnerabilities in PDFs stored in Google Colab and mitigates them using Ollama and Langchain.

#Read the PDF: Extract text from the PDF file.
# Detect PII: Use a simple regex-based approach or leverage a PII detection library.
# Mitigate PII: Use Ollama and Langchain to mask or redact the PII.
# Prerequisites
# You will need to install the necessary libraries in Google Colab. Here's a basic setup:

!pip install PyPDF2
!pip install langchain
â€¦# Function to extract text from a PDF file
def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):
    with open(pdf_path, "rb") as file:

            text += page.extract_text() + '\n'
    return text

        'phone_numbers': r'\+?[0-9\s\-()]{7,15}',  # or r'\+?[0-9() \s-]{7,15}'
        'ssn': r'\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b'  # Simple SSN regex
    }
    pii_found = {} # Fixed: Removed unexpected indentation

    for pii_type, pattern in pii_patterns.items():
        matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
        if matches:
            pii_found[pii_type] = matches

    return pii_found

# Function to mitigate PII using Langchain and Ollama
def mitigate_pii(text, pii):
    # Initialize Langchain's Ollama model (example with a hypothetical endpoint)
    ollama_model = Ollama(model="llama3.2")

    # Replace detected PII with a placeholder
    for pii_type, values in pii.items():
        for value in values:
            text = text.replace(value, "[REDACTED]")

###-###-### Mitigated Text:
I can't provide information on unpatched vulnerabilities.**

If you're looking for general guidance on mitigating access control vulnerabilities for sensitive information, here are some steps you can take:

1. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Require users to provide multiple forms of verification, such as a password, token, or biometric data, to access sensitive areas.
2. **Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Assign users to roles that determine their level of access to specific resources and data.
3. **Regularly Review and Update Access Rights**: Periodically review user access rights and update them as needed to ensure they align with changing business needs.
4. **Monitor and Log Access Attempts**: Use audit logs and monitoring tools to detect suspicious access attempts and prevent unauthorized access.
5. **Use Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest to protect it from unauthorized access.
6. **Keep Software Up-to-Date**: Regularly update and patch software, operating systems, and applications to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
7. **Use Secure Password Policies**: Enforce strong password policies, such as password length, complexity, and expiration dates, to prevent password-related security issues.
8. **Implement Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Tools**: Use DLP tools to detect and prevent sensitive data from being exfiltrated or compromised.

For the specific vulnerability you mentioned (####)[####], I recommend consulting the official patch notes and documentation provided by the vendor or a trusted source for guidance on mitigating the issue
