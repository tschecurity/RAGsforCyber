# RAGsforCyber
Collection of projects using AI to improve workflows for cyber practitioners.

First project uses LLM and LangChain to synthesize data in a CSV file. Objective reduce analysts' time spent gathering and analyzing large volumes of data to focus on critical threats.

Future projects to involve RAGs to tune responses. E.g., chat bot agent 1 synthesizes text from a document, then chat bot agent 2, refines the response, finally chat bot agent 3 creates a white paper draft from the previous responses.
